Proposal for G53PEC

Project Title: Applying Evolutionary Algorithms to Pokémon Team Building

Project Description:
The project will create a tool which can optimise a team for competitive Pokémon battling. The objective of the project is to see if Evolutionary Algorithms can solve this type of problem on a more complex data source such as finding good teams from all potential sets of Pokémon. The scenario I am going to reason about is if the software was ever released as a commercial product.
