Proposal for G53PEC

Project Title: Applying Evolutionary Algorithms to Pokémon Team Building

Project Description:
The project will create a tool which can optimise a team for competitive Pokémon battling. The objective of the project is to see if Evolutionary Algorithms can solve this type of problem on a more complex data source such as finding good teams from all potential sets of Pokémon. The scenario I am going to reason about is if the software was ever released as a commercial product.

Intellectual Property:
The program will be manipulating publicly available data from the Pokémon video games as well as potentially containing other assets from them. If it was released commercially this could be some form of intellectual property infringement.
