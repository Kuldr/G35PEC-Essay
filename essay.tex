\section{Project Title and Description}
The project that is going to be analysed is titled Applying Evolutionary Algorithms to \Pokemon{} Team Building.
The project aims to use evolutionary algorithms to evolve a competitive \Pokemon{} team for a user to be able to use.
The project will create a tool which can optimise a team for competitive Pokémon battling.
The objective of the project is to see if Evolutionary Algorithms can solve this type of problem on a more complex data source such as finding good teams from all potential sets of Pokémon.
By using the AI techniques in evolutionary algorithms the aim is to be able to provide a strong team that will be comparable with the expert designed teams.
This would be extremely helpful for newer players to get into \Pokemon{} who are potentially looking to compete at a high level such as the World Championships\cite{worldsOverview}

This project is my 3rd year dissertation project that I am currently developing.
In its current state as a dissertation project, there are few ethical issues surrounding it.
The ethical issues that will be discussed come from looking at the project as if it was extended into a commercial release.
