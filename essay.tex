\section{Project Title and Description}
The project that is going to be analysed is titled Applying Evolutionary Algorithms to \Pokemon{} Team Building.
The project aims to use evolutionary algorithms to evolve a competitive \Pokemon{} team for a user to be able to use.
The project will create a tool which can optimise a team for competitive Pokémon battling.
The objective of the project is to see if Evolutionary Algorithms can solve this type of problem on a more complex data source such as finding good teams from all potential sets of Pokémon.
By using the AI techniques in evolutionary algorithms the aim is to be able to provide a strong team that will be comparable with the expert designed teams.
This would be extremely helpful for newer players to get into \Pokemon{} who are potentially looking to compete at a high level such as the World Championships\cite{worldsOverview}.

This project is my 3rd year dissertation project that I am currently developing.
In its current state as a dissertation project, there are few ethical issues surrounding it.
The ethical issues that will be discussed come from looking at the project as if it was extended into a commercial release.

\section{Ethical Issues}
\subsection{Privacy of Users}
The majority of modern software collect some user data in some form or another, this typically happens via a login system.
For this example it is assumed that the final product would contain some form of login system which then would be used to store users settings and saved data from the system on the cloud, as well as allowing the company to contact users via an email newsletter.
This would be beneficial to the users by allowing easy access from different devices if required and to be kept up to date on the latest features.
